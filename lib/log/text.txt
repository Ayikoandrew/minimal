This is really helpful and I have actually learnt more on the UI state than before. I have actually used your explanation to implement using the immutable state UI and honestly speaking it was much easier as you can remember my initial implementation with copyWith method that was returning CarouselState. Making the class immutable just made it so much easy and with code generation, it was perfect. I am looking forward to next the post. I have a question. You talked about immutable state UI and not using it having side effects, What are these side effects?
